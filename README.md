# HTTP-Auth
The worst thing a developer can do is leave their API vulnerable. This project utilises JWT `(JSON Web Tokens)` and the `HS256` Algorithm to add authentication to your endpoints. 
The generated JWT strings serve as cryptographic evidence that the request made is authentic and coming from a real browser. **Therefore mitigating the risk of  misuse and abuse through private endpoints.**
